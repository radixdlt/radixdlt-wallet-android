# Radix DLT Android Wallet

The Radix DLT Android Wallet currently works with the live _ALPHANET_ universe and interacts with it
by making full use of the latest release of the [radixdlt-kotlin](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-kotlin) library.

The App is a work in progress and will soon be migrated to use the new version of our network.

## Android development

 * Mostly written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (A few classes are in Java but will be converted to keep it 100% Kotlin)
 * Uses [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/): Room, LiveData and Lifecycle-components
 * Uses [dagger-android](https://google.github.io/dagger/android.html) for dependency injection
 * Uses [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) 2 (Included by default by the radixdlt libs)

## Development setup

Use Android Studio 3.2.1 (or newer) to be able to build the app.

The app is currently using the latest release of the [radixdlt-kotlin](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-kotlin) library. It is 
possible to replace it with the [radixdlt-java](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-java) library but you will need to target newer
android devices >= API 24. Also, a few simple changes in the code are required and the dependency
to [rxkotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin) must be included in your gradle file.

```
implementation(group: 'io.reactivex.rxjava2', name: 'rxkotlin', version: '2.2.0') {
    exclude group: 'io.reactivex.rxjava2', module: 'rxjava'
    exclude group: 'org.jetbrains.kotlin', module: 'kotlin-stdlib'
}
```

## Code style

This project uses [ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint) via [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) dependency.
To check code style - `gradle ktlint` (it's also bound to `gradle check`).
